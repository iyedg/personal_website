I'm a data engineer working at the intersection of technology and humanitarian action. Currently based in Jordan as a Global Data Specialist at IMPACT Initiatives, I build data infrastructure and pipelines that help humanitarian organizations respond effectively to crises.

## What I Do

I design end-to-end data solutions - from building ELT pipelines and REST APIs to creating interactive dashboards and data validation systems. Whether it's processing migration data across multiple countries or building monitoring systems for humanitarian assessments, I focus on making data accessible and actionable for decision-makers in the field.

## International Experience

My career has taken me across the Middle East and North Africa. I'm currently based in Jordan working with IMPACT Initiatives on global data operations. Previously, I worked on Yemen programs from Amman and Libya operations from Tunis. At the Mixed Migration Centre, I served as Regional Information Management Specialist covering West and North Africa, analyzing migration trends and data across the region. I spent nearly four years with Al Bawsala, a democracy and civic space watchdog in Tunisia, where I eventually led their data and IT operations.

I've also had experience in the private sector with Safran in Tunisia and studied business administration at Delta State University in the US - experiences that gave me diverse perspectives on how different organizations approach data challenges.

## Technical Interests & Approach

I work primarily with Python, R, and SQL for data engineering and analysis. I'm a certified **dlt ELT Specialist** and **dlt Advanced ELT Specialist**. Looking at my GitHub, you'll see I have a particular interest in:

- **Data extraction and web scraping** - from monitoring Tunisia's national consultation (e_istichara_monitor) to extracting data from official PDFs
- **Survey data tools** - I built quiveR, an R package for working with KoBo Toolbox and ODK, essential tools in humanitarian data collection
- **Interactive dashboards** - especially with Plotly Dash for making complex data accessible
- **Data quality and validation** - I've contributed to tools like Pandera for ensuring data integrity
- **Tunisia-specific data projects** - elections, municipal performance, budgets, inflation, trade policy - basically trying to make public data more accessible and analyzable

I'm also into experimenting with different tech stacks (you'll find Julia, Lua, even some Neovim configs in my repos) and I'm always looking for better ways to build reproducible data pipelines.

## Why This Blog

I started this blog to share practical solutions to real-world data problems I encounter. You'll find posts on building COVID-19 dashboards, analyzing poverty rates, tracking vaccination campaigns, and other projects mostly focused on Tunisia and the MENA region. I believe in learning in public and helping others tackle similar challenges.

## Background

I hold a Master's degree in Business Analytics from Tunis Business School. I speak Arabic, French, and English, which comes in handy when working across different regional contexts.

When I'm not wrangling data, I'm usually exploring new tools and technologies, teaching workshops (like SQL for the Data Science Club at Tunis Business School), or thinking about how to make humanitarian data systems more efficient and accessible.
