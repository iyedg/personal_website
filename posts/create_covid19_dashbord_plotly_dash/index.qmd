Can you create a pretty and usable dashboard without knowing much about frontend development ?
Various attempts at making the answer to this question a `YES` have been made with varying degrees of success.
Probably the most famous attempts are tools like PowerBI Microsoft or Tableau which have a relatively low barrier to entry compared to solutions that involve coding.
Even the omnipresent *(but far form omnipotent)* Excel could be used as a dashboarding tool.
But that comes at a cost of lower customizability / extensibility.
It goes without saying that using these solutions for commercial uses
 cost vastly more despite having very usable versions for users who wish
 to try the tools.

In this tutorial we will focus on [**Dash**](https://dash.plotly.com/) by Plotly,
the creators of the [eponymous plotting library](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py).
Keep in mind, however, that the python ecosystem offers a variety of tools with various tradeoffs and considerations.
None of these solutions is a cure-all, therefore it is wise to keep an open mind and tinker with some of them *(all of them ?)*.

By the end of this tutorial we will have a dashboard that looks like this:

## Elements of a `Plotly Dash` project

It is important before we start building our dashboard that we understand some concepts driving **Dash**.
The first idea we will touch on is *reactive programming*.

### Reactivity and Callbacks

Even if you don't know what *reactive programming* means you've most likely used it in ... Excel.

In Excel, when we use a formula to compute the sum of two cells,
as soon as a value in the summation changes, the formula cell recomputes its value in reaction.

<figure>
<video style="width:100%;" id="excel_reactive" autoplay controls>
        <source src="videos/excel_reactive.mp4">
</video>
<figcaption>
<span>Excel is a reactive program</span>
</figcaption>
</figure>

The equivalent idea to an Excel formula for Dash is a callback function.

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "1-4"
@app.callback(
    output=Output("ouput-cell", "value"),
    inputs=[Input("cell-1", "value"), Input("cell-2", "value")],
)
def sum_of_cell1_and_cell2(value_of_cell1, value_of_cell2):
    return value_of_cell1 + value_of_cell2
```

In the highlighted lines 1-4, we are saying that the attribute `value` of an object with and ID of `output-cell` should react to
changes in the `value` attribute of the objects with ID `cell-1` and `cell-2`.

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "5-6"
@app.callback(
    output=Output("ouput-cell", "value"),
    inputs=[Input("cell-1", "value"), Input("cell-2", "value")],
)
def sum_of_cell1_and_cell2(value_of_cell1, value_of_cell2):
    return value_of_cell1 + value_of_cell2
```

![Callbacks diagram](images/reactivity_callback_chain.png)

In the function definition we describe how the `value` attribute of `output-cell` should react
to a change in the `value` attribute of `cell-1` and / or `cell-2`.
In our case that would be to return the sum of the values.

It is not important to focus on the syntax for now,
we are simply building a conceptual model of how Dash works.
One question that arises from the snippet we have just seen is *what are* `output-cell`, `cell-1` *and* `cell-2` *?*

### Layout

To continue our Excel simile, let us think of an Excel cell as a special kind of user interface components.
In essence, a cell in a spredsheet is not that much different from an input box, a checkbox, or a dropdown list.
These user interface elements can hold various attributes of their own, including a `value` attribute,
and allow the user to trigger callbacks which ultimately allows our dashboard to *react* to user input.

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "8-14"
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html
import dash
from dash.dependencies import Input, Output

app = dash.Dash(__name__)

app.layout = html.Div(
    children=[
        dcc.Input(id="cell-1", type="number", value=30),
        dcc.Input(id="cell-2", type="number", value=4),
        html.H1(id="output-cell"),
    ]
)

@app.callback(
    output=Output("output-cell", "children"),
    inputs=[Input("cell-1", "value"), Input("cell-2", "value")],
)
def sum_of_cell1_and_cell2(value_of_cell1, value_of_cell2):
    return int(value_of_cell1) + int(value_of_cell2)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server(host="localhost", debug=True)
```

With the addition of a layout as described in the lines 8 through 14, our dashboard can now
display a user interface, and react to changes triggered by user input. Running the code above results in
the following "*dashboard*"

### Virtual environment and dependencies installation

For this project we will need to install the following dependencies:

* **dash** is the library that will provide two components for our project: the dashboarding and the plotting through `plotly-express` which we will introduce as we go.
* **dash-bootstrap-components** will allow us to theme our app using Bootstrap which provides useful layout capabilities and interesting components. For this tutorial we will limit ourselves to using the Grid
* **pandas** which we will use for the data manipulation part.
* **geopandas** will be of use when plotting data on a map.
* **pyprojroot** is a small utility library that allows us to reference files inside our project using paths relative the root of our project instead of absolute *long* paths.

You can install them using the following command

```shell
pip install dash==1.11.0 dash-bootstrap-components pandas geopandas requests pyprojroot
```

It is recommended that you create a virtual environment for your project. That
can be done easily (assuming you're running a Unix based system):

```bash
md covid_dash
cd covid_dash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Directory structure

The directory structure that we will need looks as follows

```bash
.
├── data
│  └── raw
└── src
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── app.py
   ├── callbacks.py
   ├── cli.py
   ├── data.py
   ├── index.py
   ├── layouts.py
   └── plots.py
```

To create it you can run the following commands

```sh
md -p plotly_dash_tutorial/{data/raw,src}
cd plotly_dash_tutorial
touch src/__init__.py # Making a python package named src
touch src/{app.py,index.py} # General application / dashboard code
touch src/{callbacks.py,layouts.py} # Plotly dash specific code
touch src/{plots.py,data.py} # The model part of our application
```

### Application setup

To setup our app, we need to create an `app` object.
This object is central to our application in the sense that it acts as the
orchestrator of the interaction between our layout components through the callbacks we define.

In addition to creating a Dash `app` object, we pass style information through
the `external_stylesheets` key word.

**app.py**

```{python}
#| eval: false
import dash

import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc

app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.YETI, "custom.css"])
```

`index.py` will act as the entry point to our dashboard. The lines 7-8 allow
python to call the `run_server` method from our Dash `app` object if `index.py`
is called from the command line. The key word `debug` provides us with
autoreload and more expressive UI side error, therefore when developing a
dashboard it is recommended that it be set to True.

You may notice that we've only used two of our imports in the body of
`index.py`. We used the app to start a server for our dashboard, and use the
layout import to attach it to our `app` object, what about `callbacks` ? One may
be inclined to remove the line importing `callbacks` but that would mean that
our app will not have access to any logic we define in our callbacks.

**index.py**

```{python}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "1-5"
from . import callbacks
from .app import app
from .layouts import layout

app.layout = layout

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server(host="localhost", debug=True)
```

### Creating the layout

**layouts.py**

```{python}
#| eval: false
import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html
```

Let's begin by discussing the imported modules for `layouts.py`.
`dash_bootstrap_components`, `dash_core_components` and `dash_html_components`
contain components which correspond to HTML elements. These are what largely
liberates the developers from actually writing HTML, CSS which are responsible
for the View layer of our dashboard. The components provided by these modules
can vary in complexity from being a mere text container such as `html.H1` to a
full interactive table such as `dcc.DataTable`. It is generally useful to keep
the documentation from theses modules open in a side tab while creating the
dashboard.

The general layout of our page is composed of two major containers, a sidebar
and a main content area.

![Base layout](images/Base%20layout.png)

Our main container uses the self-descriptive component `bcc.Container`.
It is, however, important that we understand that despite this component
and similar *layout* components, do not translate directly into visible elements
on our page, they modify the *position* of elements on the page. In
addition, the `Container` component comes with the added benefit of adding
*responsivity* to our page thanks to being based on Bootstrap, which further
improves the usability of our dashboard.

As a rule of thumb, components from `dash_html_components`
correspond to HTML elements, and they are named as such.
For instance, an `h1` element in raw HTML corresponds to `html.H1` *(notice the
capitalization)*. By contrast, components from `dash_core_components` contain
components with interactivity baked into them such as tabs, dropdown lists and
data tables.

**layouts.py**

```python
SIDEBAR_STYLE = {
    "position": "fixed",
    "top": 0,
    "left": 0,
    "bottom": 0,
    "width": "18rem",
    "padding": "2rem 1rem",
    "background-color": "#f8f9fa",
}

MAIN_CONTAINER_STYLE = {
    "margin-left": "18rem",
    "margin-right": "2rem",
    "padding": "2rem 1rem",
    "height": "100vh",
}

sidebar = html.Div(
    [
        html.H3("COVID19 dashboard for cases in Tunisia"),
        html.Hr(),
    ],
    style=SIDEBAR_STYLE,
)

main_container = dbc.Container(
    [
        dcc.Loading(
            dcc.Graph(
                id="main_graph",
                figure=figure,
            )
        ),
    ],
    style=MAIN_CONTAINER_STYLE,
    id="main_container",
)

layout = dbc.Container([sidebar, main_container], fluid=True)
```

As for the dictionaries `SIDEBAR_STYLE` and `MAIN_CONTENT_STYLE` they are used
to show that there are multiple ways to define the style and layout of our
components. In both cases, we must provide valid CSS rules. Dictionaries of
style may be useful when we have a style rule specific to a component or simply
as a shorthand for writing an external CSS stylesheet.

It is also worth noting that we must assign and `id` to each component we will
interact with later on in our callbacks.

**layouts.py**

```python
id="main_container"
```

Finally, we define our root container and simply set `sidebar` and
`main_container` as its children.

Now we will go over the specific components that we will use in this dashboard:

#### `dcc.RadioItems`

Radio Items are generally used in groups where the user must choose exactly one
option, and must choose an option. To this end, we will use the `dcc.RadioItems`
component to get let the user choose the data view they want displayd in the
main container area of our page. We will have three options:

* Map view
* Line chart view
* Bar race chart view

To implement this use case in Dash, we write the following code:

**layouts.py**

```python
view_selector = html.Div(
    [
        html.H4("Dashboard view"),
        dcc.RadioItems(
            id="content_view_selector",
            options=[
                {"label": "Map view", "value": "map"},
                {"label": "Line chart view", "value": "line"},
                {"label": "Bar race chart view", "value": "bar_race"},
            ],
            value="map",
            labelStyle={"display": "block"},
        ),
    ]
)
```

Essentially, the `RadioItems` components takes a list of dictionaries as
`options`. Each dictionary must have at least the two keys `label` and `value`.
The label of the option is the text that will be shown on the user interface,
while `value` is a corresponding alias that we use internally in our code, which
means it is possible to have the label and the value be the same string. The
`value` key word provides the default value of our component.

As we mentioned before, since we will be interacting with this component, we
must give it an id, `content_view_selector` in this specific case.

#### `dcc.Dropdown`

Dropdown lists are very similar to a Radio Items group in that they allow the
user to  pick choice(s) from a list of possible options. The difference, despite
being subtle, is rather important: Dropdown lists *may* allow a user to pick
more than one choice. In addition, on a user experience level, dropdown lists
are usually reserved for longer lists of options as a means to declutter our
interface. In our specific case we could have used another Radio Items group but
the dropdown list is used merely to illustrate another component.

Notice that in this instance we assign the options keys `label` and `value` the
same text out of a list of possible choices `by_gov_indicators`. This pattern
can be useful when the text to display and the internal value used in the code
do not differ.

We set the key word `clearable` to False to force the component to always have a
value that is not `NULL`.

**layouts.py**

```python
indicator_selector = html.Div(
    [
        html.H4("Indicator"),
        dcc.Dropdown(
            id="indicator_selector",
            options=[
                {"label": indicator, "value": indicator}
                for indicator in by_gov_indicators
            ],
            value=by_gov_indicators[0],
            clearable=False,
        ),
    ]
)
```

#### `dcc.Graph`

Now we address the most important component of our Dashboard, in terms of real
estate on the screen and in terms of value: the `dcc.Graph`.

**layouts.py**

```python
dcc.Graph(
    id="main_graph",
    figure=figure,
)
```

That's it !

The graph component does not take any fiddling around. In the general case we
will just provide it with a `Figure` object from `plotly.express` or
`plotly.graph_objects` or even nested python dictionaries describing the figure.

Now our Interface should look somehting like this:

![Finished layout](images/finished_layout.png)

#### Callbacks: reacting to user input

If we were to run our dashboard as it is now, we would be greeted with a well
laid out set of components on a page that do nothing. The missing ingredient is
callbacks.

**callbacks.py**

```python
from dash.dependencies import Input, Output
from .app import app

from .plots import (
    plot_daily_cumulative_active_cases,
    plot_part_of_daily_active_cases,
    plot_race_plot_of_cumulative_daily_active_cases,
)
from .data import geo_targa_covid_df


@app.callback(
    Output("main_graph", "figure"),
    [Input("content_view_selector", "value"), Input("indicator_selector", "value")],
)
def update_main_content(view, indicator):
    if view == "map" or view is None:
        return plot_part_of_daily_active_cases(geo_targa_covid_df, indicator)
    elif view == "line":
        return plot_daily_cumulative_active_cases(geo_targa_covid_df, indicator)
    else:
        return plot_race_plot_of_cumulative_daily_active_cases(
            geo_targa_covid_df, indicator
        )
```

As can be seen, `callbacks.py` does not contain much code, so let us dissect it
bit by bit.

**callbacks.py**

```{python}
#| eval: false
from dash.dependencies import Input, Output
from .app import app
```

In the first line, we import `Input` and `Output` which are functions that allow
us to define the direction of the flow of information in our app. Then we import
the `app` object as it will be used to define the callback functions later.

`Input` and `Output` have a similar function signature; both of them take two
arguments: `component_id` and `component_property`. These information allow Dash
to build a dependency tree between the various properties of the components that
we use in our callbacks. In our case, when we set the `Output` of our callback
function `update_main_content` to the `figure` property of `main_graph`, we are
describing a flow of information from the inputs of our callback function: the
`value` property of `content_view_selector` and `indicator_selector`, through
the body of our callback function where we transform and / or augment the values
we've received, and returing the information that changes the `figure` property
of `main_graph`.

![Final dashboard callback chain](images/final_callback_chain.png)

To understand the specific flow in information in our callback, let us look back
at the main body of the callback function:

**callbacks.py**

```python
@app.callback(
    Output("main_graph", "figure"),
    [Input("content_view_selector", "value"), Input("indicator_selector", "value")],
)
def update_main_content(view, indicator):
    if view == "map" or view is None:
        return plot_part_of_daily_active_cases(geo_targa_covid_df, indicator)
    elif view == "line":
        return plot_daily_cumulative_active_cases(geo_targa_covid_df, indicator)
    else:
        return plot_race_plot_of_cumulative_daily_active_cases(
            geo_targa_covid_df, indicator
        )
```

Firstly, you should notice the order of the arguments of our function: `view`
then `indicator`. This order corresponds to the order in which we declared our
dependent inputs when calling `@app.callback`.

> A Dash callback function takes only positional arguments whose order corresponds
> to the order of `Inputs` <small>*and `states` also but that's another topic*</small>.

#### General application files

In `callbacks.py` we imported objects from two modules: `data` and `plots`.
I have created these two modules primarily to declutter the `callbacks.py` and
`layouts.py` files. But it is also a good practice following the [Don't repeat
yourself Principle (**DRY**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) as well
as [Separation of Concerns
(**SoC**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). By using a
module where I include all the steps of data preparation, and another where I
include all the code necessary for generating my plots, I am avoiding creating a
huge cluster of code that is less maintainable and a headache to extend and / or
refactor.

> To see how the data was prepared please refer to [this notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/iyedg/iyedg.github.io/blob/develop/content/post/create_covid19_dashbord_plotly_dash/notebooks/01_data_preparation.ipynb) and to [data.py](https://github.com/iyedg/plotly_dash_tutorial_code/blob/master/src/data.py)

## Parting thoughts

The creation of dashboards with a tool such as Plotly Dash is definitely much
more involved that its WYSIWYG counterparts. However I found through my
experience with making dashboards that with a correct assessment of the needs,
choosing to code your own dashboard may prove a vastly more pleasurable
experience both in creating and in maintaining it. As Abraham
Maslow once wrote

> If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail[^1]

Tools like Dash should not be used as a cure-all solution, but neither should
Excel or Tableau. That is why the more tools in your toolbelts, the less effort
you will spend hammering nails.
